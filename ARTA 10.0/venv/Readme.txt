ARTA - Adaptive Rhythmic Training Application

Instructions:

1) Install the packages in your python environment 

2) Follow the instructions in the main.py file, commenting the different sections according to what your which to do with the program.

3) After you are done with a training (at least 8 rounds of training in mode 0), look at the Performance/performance_data/Readme-Folders.txt document to understand the structure of the app.

4) Train the neural network

5) Optimize best rhythmic patterns (those associated with the best performance during your training)

6) Analyze the results in the generated graphics (plots

7) To get a detailed description of how this app was used in my bachelor project and how it can be used to generated new rhythmic patterns 
   to train motor skills, you can read my bachelor project at the following link: https://www.academia.edu/79300882/Conception_of_New_Rhythm_Based_Dexterity_Training_Methods_with_Adaptive_Mechanics_and_AI
   (I highly recommand reading it if you want to understand what the circles in the rhythmic patterns stand for)
