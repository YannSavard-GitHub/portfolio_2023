Folders Descriptions:

raw_output_data: 

This folder contains the raw data generated when training in mode 0 (training for the A.I. with the neural network)


raw_output_data_day_1 and raw_output_data_day_2:

Those are the raw-output-data generated by different people involved in the evaluation trainings of my bachelor project, found at this adress:
"https://www.academia.edu/79300882/Conception_of_New_Rhythm_Based_Dexterity_Training_Methods_with_Adaptive_Mechanics_and_AI" 

They could be used in the future to train other neural networks with more advanced techniques.


data_set:
This folder is managed automatically when the section Generate Dataset - of main.py file of run. 
The input data for the neural network will be generated in that folder.


evaluation_graphics:
All graphics resulting from trainings are generated in that folder, including the evaluation graphics.


Evaluation Training 1 and Evaluation Training 2:
All the raw input data and results of evaluation training 1 and 2 of my bachelor project.

MACHINE LEARNING PRACTICE:

If you want to experiment with the neural network, follow the instructions in the project file main.py

Have fun!
